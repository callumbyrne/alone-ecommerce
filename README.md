This project was a frontend focused project built with NextJS, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS. It utilises Sanity CMS to manage all the product data as well as Stripe for checkout and payments. A main aspect of this project was practicing building a fully responsive frontend which was achieved using TailwindCSS. The application was built with a mobile first design with styling changes made incrementally up to a desktop sized display.


This project was also an opportunity to try Reacts Context API for global state management. For this project the state management wasn't too complex, however, in the future I would like to test out a few dedicated state management libraries such as Zustand, React Query and Redux Toolkit for comparison.
